<h3>"I Love You."</h3>
  <p>Your love is like a rose, delicate but oh so radiant. I pour my everything into you like the sweetest water, nurturing you and watching you flourish. Though when I wish to hold you near as my own to keep, you pierce me with your thorns.</p>
  <p>You cut me deep until I bleed rivers of red. But I still love you. Why can't you love me back?</p>
